# AMD-ComicsFaces
Code and LaTeX paper for the project of Algorithms for Massive Datasets

The first notebook that has to be run is Data_Preparation. After that, run directly ALL_MODELS.
I uploaded also the singular notebooks for each networks architecture variant.

I created a repository in Drive (/content/drive/MyDrive/ComicsFaces) where I extracted and uploaded the dataset. Then, in the Data Preparation notebook, I created the pickled files of images (X.pickle) and labels (y.pickle) and stored them in the subfolder /content/drive/MyDrive/ComicsFaces/Pickles. I made the repositories public, so you can just copy and paste the links of the pickles or the repository instead of creating one anew.

Notebooks repository = https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y98kCiYTcLYfD8Ar_5oenYV_pvLjk-oP?usp=share_link

ComicsFaces personal repository (with pickles files) = https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170u9lCZBOGLQ-9z_P_UW55SqEsYVlv-H?usp=share_link
X.pickle = pickles of the images
y.pickle = pickle of the labels
